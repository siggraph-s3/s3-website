While volunteering with SIGGRAPH Student Services, I also work full time as a Digital Media Designer at Gannett with past experience as a freelance animator and digital imaging specialist. My first SIGGRAPH was in 2008 where I joined the ranks of the Student Volunteers and have been back every year since. For me, SIGGRAPH has come to feel like a big family reunion that also doubles as a chance for everyone to nerd-out with cutting-edge tech and research within computer graphics.
