New for 2022 the XSV Program has been rebranded to the Conference Apprentice Program (CAP)!

CAP is a unique opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes perspective on everything involved with an ACM SIGGRAPH Executive Committee or a specific SIGGRAPH Conference program.

As a Conference Apprentice, you will either take on a specific role on an ACM SIGGRAPH Executive or SIGGRAPH Conference Committee. You will be mentored by an ACM SIGGRAPH or SIGGRAPH Conference Committee member and have the opportunity to build your SIGGRAPH network by meeting and learning from the professionals, creators, educators, and visionaries who make SIGGRAPH possible. Individuals who demonstrate leadership and a passion for volunteering for SIGGRAPH are encouraged to apply!

This experience is available to those who are no longer eligible to serve as a SIGGRAPH Conference Student Volunteer or Team Leader. Applicants must have attended the SIGGRAPH Conference at least once in the last 3 years.

Don’t miss out on the opportunity to expand your knowledge of what goes into putting this awesome conference together each year and get involved with the SIGGRAPH community!
