Madi Janolino is a recent graduate from the Experimental Animation program of the University of Central Florida as a 2D and 3D animator. She has a fascination for the growing scene of adult animation and the inclusion of animation as a medium for outstanding expression following its social and technical developments.

She started working as a conference SV in 2017 and in 2019 she was elected president of her student chapter. While in school and organizing events, she fortified the chapter by establishing social media foot-holds to gain traction and attention of members. Her encounters with the ACM SIGGRAPH conferences had given her a great amount of pride and inspiration over the solidarity of the industry. These now drive her to offer that opportunity to rising professionals. Madi has built the first Discord server for the S3 program to connect its members with all of the official ACM SIGGRAPH’s social media accounts, as well as establish relationships with future peers of the emerging media industry.’
